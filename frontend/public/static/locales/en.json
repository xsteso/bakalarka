Then hit START to start the game. (We collect these information just for the internal statistics purposes. We dont share them with any third party.)",
      "STEP_2": "The <span style=\"color: blue\">dots</span> you can see at the top show the number of emails in your gamerun as well as the current email you are working with. Then in the header you can see the email subject, <span style=\"color: red\">email address of the sender</span> and the <span style=\"color: green\">arrival date</span>. Below the line thete is the <span style=\"color: orange\">email body</span>.",
      "STEP_3": "Your objective in this game is to decide, if the email you are seeing is legitimate or a phishing email. At the bottom you will find three buttons. <span style=\"color: blue\">The first one named HINTS</span> can give you advice about signs you need to look for when deciding. The <span style=\"color: red\">red one marks the e-mail as phishing</span> and the <span style=\"color: green\">green as a legitimate e-mail</span>.",
      "STEP_4": "After you are done with marking all of the emails in your gamerun you will see the summary page with your result. There you can see <span style=\"color: red\">how many emails you marked correctly</span>, <span style=\"color: green\">how long did it take you to finish the gamerun</span> and lastly the <span style=\"color: blue\">username you used</span> and the <span style=\"color: orange\">date of your gamerun</span>.",
      "STEP_5": "Below the result summary you can see individual answer to each email. In this detail you can see <span style=\"color: red\">your answer</span>, <span style=\"color: blue\">how long did it take you</span> to decide and also the <span style=\"color: green\">average values</span> for the specific email. At the bottom is the <span style=\"color: orange\">correct answer</span> with the email type.",
      "STEP_6": "If you are not sure, why did you answer incorrectly, or you just want to look at the email detail again press the SHOW DETAIL button. This will open you an email body detail with <span style=\"color: blue\">highlighted parts</span> indicating the <span style=\"color: red\">phishing signs the email has</span>. To show it hover over it with mouse or press on it on mobile."
