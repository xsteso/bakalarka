Hi Dear,</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
My apology as I am contacting you through email; It is because it serves as the fastest and more convenient way to get to you, my name is Ilana Solomon Shneor a widow from Israel born in Austria. I understand we have not known each other before now, but my desire to invest in your country inspired me to contact you as I believe that our world is a global village where one can establish a good business and investment relationship before meeting each other physically.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I have a proposition involving a fund transaction unfinished by my late Husband who died as the result of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We planned to invest in the Dubai 2020 Expo before his death, due to my health condition I cant handle the transaction. I solicit partnership with companies/individual business and NGO foundations that lost so much in the cause of the COVID-19 situation. My desire is to partner with profitable businesses.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I will appreciate your reply for more details about me and the transaction on how we can proceed to move the fund to you by the Bank under a contract. Please Respond to me on my private email: ilanasshneorn@gmail.com</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
Sincerely,</DIV>
<DIV>
Ilana Solomon Shneor(Mrs.)</DIV>
