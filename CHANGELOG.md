# Changelog

The current version of the application is based on the previously developed prototype. The prototype version was developed by **Patrik Brosz**, and **Marko Ondrejička** developed the current revised final version. This changelog defines what remained the same from the prototype and what was refactored, redesigned, or completely changed in the final version.

## Backend

The backend part core logic of the application, except for minor tweaks and extensions, remained the same as the prototype. By the core logic, we identify the following:

* The logical model and related Django logic,
* Use of relational database to store data,
* Authentication,
* Email import logic,
* Gamerun answers handling,
* REST API communication

## Frontend

The frontend part core login and concepts that remained unchanged are:

* The logical division of player and admin sections,
* State management,
* Use of the Material design,
* Form and Table building blocks,
* Authentication-related logic

## Final version

The functionality of the final version of the application vastly changed from the prototype version. Everything else was refactored, revised, redesigned, or extended by new functionality except for the logic and concepts mentioned in the Backend and Frontend sections lists. This changelog is only a brief overview of the work done in this application, backed by the GIT repository included in this archive.
